## 🧠 About the Project

**Foto Forensics** is a full-stack web application created as part of an **engineering thesis project** in the field of *Modern Technologies in Forensics*.  
The system provides a digital forensics environment that allows users to analyze images for:

- 🔍 **Hidden or manipulated content detection (Steganography)**
- 🧠 **Device identification**
- 🧾 **EXIF and metadata extraction**
- 📊 **Visualization of forensic results through interactive reports**

The goal of this project is to make advanced forensic image analysis accessible through an intuitive and visually engaging web interface.  
The project is accompanied by a diploma thesis that expands on the theoretical and technical aspects of the system.
